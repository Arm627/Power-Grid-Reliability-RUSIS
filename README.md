# Power-Grid-Reliability-RUSIS
Research for Undergraduates Summer Institute of Statistics (RUSIS) project to model for the reliability of an arbitrary power grid.

The tech report is the file: RUSIS_Power_Grid_Reliability.pdf <br>
The recursive method is the R code: RecursiveModel.R <br>
The moment generating function method is the R code: MGFModelV4.R <br>
The polynomial method (the most optimal method) is the R code: PolynomialModel.R <br>
